  - Input: JSON (email, password, first_name, last_name, phone_number)
  - Output: 201 Created / 400 Bad Request / 409 Conflict
- `POST /api/v1/login`  
  - Input: JSON (email, password)
  - Output: 200 OK + JWT Token / 401 Unauthorized

  - Output: User profile (requires token)

### Validation Rules:
- Email must be unique and valid.
- Password must be at least 8 characters.
